# Before you get started...

Welcome to Timeout, the SRCF's solution to a free, easy and convenient video conferencing system. The full terms of service is available [here](https://docs.srcf.net/timeout/tos.html). 

Use of Timeout for work not directly related to the University is allowed as we understand the value of keeping in touch with friends and family during these trying times.
  
## Notes on privacy and data

We value your privacy, notably in regards to:

* The storage of cookies - we only store what is essential for the operation of Greenlight (the front-end) and BigBlueButton
* Recording - rooms are only recorded if the host allows them to be
  * We have made the recording of rooms toggleable per room
  * Due to the way that BigBlueButton manages recordings, the only way to be absolutely sure your data will not be stored on our system is to disable recordings. If you enable recordings for a room but don't press record, your unprocessed data files will still be stored for an indefinite period of on our system. **This makes it possible for you to ask us for a room recording even if you forgot to press record!**

For a more detailed explanation of our systems, please visit [our detailed documentation](https://docs.srcf.net/timeout).
